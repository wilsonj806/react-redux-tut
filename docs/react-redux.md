# React Redux

## General Description

We have our `store` for storing state, and we have reducers for handling state changes, but we'll need to integrate this all with our React components/ app. React-Redux introduces a new design pattern to handle all of this, presentational/ container components, which will be elaborated on here.

Before we begin, make sure you have the official React-Redux bindings!
  ```
  npm i react-redux
  ```

## Presentational and Container Components

The React-Redux bindings make a distinction between presentational and container components. In short, it distinguishes between components that renders as a UI element, and components that handle and pass around data.

See the below table for a quick summary or this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) for more.

|  | **Presentational** | **Container** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | How things look(markup, style) | How things work(data fetching, state update) |
| **Aware of Redux** | No | Yes |
| **To read data** | Read data from props | Subscribe to Redux state |
| **To change data** | Invoke callbacks from props | Dispatch Redux actions |
| **Are written** | By hand | Generated by React Redux |

Most of the components we write will be presentational, but we'll need to have container components to handle state.

Technically you could write the container components by hand using `store.subscribe()`. The Redux docs don't recommend doing this as React Redux makes performance optimizations that you probably shouldn't try. We'll be using React Redux's `connect()` function to write them instaed.
